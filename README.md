# GTA V Online AHK-Macros

All credit for this great piece of software goes to [2called-chaos](https://github.com/2called-chaos). 

[Original Repo](https://github.com/2called-chaos/gtav-online-ahk)

I would always be using this script until I just hopped back on GTA the other day and noticed the new update messed stuff up, so I figured I would do what I can to help out anyone who wants to keep using this until the official version gets fully updated by [2called-chaos](https://github.com/2called-chaos). :)

# Disclaimer
All I've tried to do with my fork is to make the script compatible with new GTA version 1.67, as the interaction menu changed slightly, making some of the macros no longer work.

I'm not very good with AHK but I think this should be a working version for GTA v1.67+, everything I use regularly worked with my testing however there are a few things I couldn't test such as:

- have not tested manual inv settings 
- have not tested CPH mode
- not sure what needs to be done with VIP toggle/check now that interaction menu changed (so I just turned it off)

Things that needed changed slightly and should now work on v1.67:
- openOutfitMenu
- ToggleRadar
- ArmorMenu
- SnackMenu
- EquipScarf
- RetrieveCar
- RequestSparrow
- ReturnSparrow

If there's anything else that needs fixed temporarily until 2called-chaos does, I possibly can just let me know.
Thank you again [2called-chaos](https://github.com/2called-chaos), for this and hope to see it still being updated in the future.
